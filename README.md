# miniaturized_bot_two

## Introduction
This project involves the development of the miniaturized_bot_two, an autonomous robot designed for educational and research purposes. The miniaturized_bot_two is equipped with a variety of sensors and modules to facilitate learning and experimentation in robotics.

## Project Components
### Hardware
- **Motor Driver Module:** Controls the left and right motors for movement.
- **PICO:** Central microcontroller unit that orchestrates sensor inputs and motor outputs.
- **LIDAR:** Used for obstacle detection and navigation.
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** Provides data on the robot's orientation and acceleration.
- **IR Sensors:** Allow for obstacle avoidance and edge detection.
- **Servo Motors:** Enable precise control over mechanical movements.
- **OLED Display:** Shows real-time status and information.
- **LEDs:** Indicate status and alerts.

### Software
- Code written in Python and C for controlling the robot's hardware, managing sensor data, and implementing navigation algorithms.

## Schematic Diagram
The schematic diagram included in the `ATR_bot_V2.0.pdf` provides a detailed view of all the electronic components and their connections. This diagram is essential for understanding the wiring and setup required to replicate or modify the hardware.

## Gallery
Images and videos in the repository showcase the robot in action, its assembly, and various components:
- `IMG_0178.JPG`, `IMG_0527.DNG`, and other images provide views of the robot from different angles.
- `IMG_1043.mov` and `IMG_1066.mov` are motion videos demonstrating the robot's capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Assembly:** Refer to the schematic diagram for detailed wiring and component assembly.
2. **Software Installation:**
   - Flash the provided code onto the PICO using any standard Python IDE that supports microcontroller programming.
   - Ensure all library dependencies are satisfied.
3. **Testing:**
   - Power on the robot and perform initial tests to check sensor readings and motor responses.

## Usage
- Power up the robot.
- Use the push buttons to initiate different modes (e.g., autonomous navigation, follow-the-leader).
- The OLED display will provide real-time feedback on the robot's status and mode.

## Troubleshooting
- **Motor Issues:** Check connections as per the schematic if motors do not respond.
- **Sensor Data:** Ensure no physical blockage on sensors if readings are erratic.
